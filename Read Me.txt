	NCOA is a service provied by the USPS for businesses. When we send notifications to debtors that they are in collections we get a file from USPS of all the persons that have moved or if the address doesn't exist. The file comes in a fixed field format. My program takes the data provided and updates our collection software database. This program is a windows GUI application, it isn't packaged but you can open it by clicking on NCOAapp.py
